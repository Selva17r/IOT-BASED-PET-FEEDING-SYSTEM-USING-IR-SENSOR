**Overview**

An IoT-based smart pet feeding system that allows pet owners to automate feeding schedules, control food portions, and monitor their pets remotely. Built using simple hardware components and microcontrollers, this project ensures pets are fed on time—even when owners are away.

**Features**

- Automated Feeding Schedule – Set feeding times in advance.

- Remote Control – Start feeding using a mobile app or web dashboard.

- Portion Control – Dispense the right amount of food.

- Notifications/Alerts – Get notified when feeding is complete.

- Energy Efficient – Low power consumption hardware design.

**Tech Stack**

Hardware: Arduino/ESP32 (or your chosen microcontroller), Servo Motor, Food Dispenser Mechanism, Sensors

Software: Arduino IDE / C++, IoT Platform (Blynk / MQTT / Firebase / etc.)

Connectivity: Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266/ESP32)

**How It Works**

- User sets feeding schedule via app/web.

- System triggers servo motor to release food at the scheduled time.

- Sensors track food dispensing and send feedback to the app.

- Notifications alert the pet owner when feeding is completed.

**Setup & Installation**

- Clone this repository.

- Open the project in Arduino IDE.

- Install required libraries.

- Connect hardware as per circuit diagram.

- Upload the code and configure Wi-Fi credentials.

**Future Improvements**

- Live camera monitoring of pets

- Multi-pet support with separate portions

- Cloud-based analytics for feeding history
